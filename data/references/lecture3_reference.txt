This lecture introduces Aníbal Quijano, a Peruvian sociologist whose work evolved from dependency theory focused on political economy, to studies of culture and identity, and later to decolonial theory centered on knowledge and power. His work is part of the Modernity/Coloniality/Decoloniality (MCD) project, which challenges the idea that Western modernity developed independently. Modernity is shown as historically tied to colonial expansion, while coloniality refers to the lasting systems of domination that privilege Western knowledge and obscure Indigenous ways of knowing. Decoloniality centers non-Western worldviews and seeks to dismantle these power structures.

Quijano’s framework highlights the co-constitution of modernity and colonialism, racial hierarchies, labor control, global capitalism, and national identity. The Coloniality of Power began in the Americas with the invention of race as a social category to justify conquest. Europeans were positioned as superior while Indigenous and African peoples were placed into systems of forced labor such as slavery, encomienda, and mita to produce commodities for the global market. This created a racial division of labor that became naturalized over time through scientific racism and caste systems.

Eurocentrism is presented as a dominant mode of knowledge production that frames Europe as the center of progress, development, and democracy. Linear models of history such as “developed vs. underdeveloped” and “First vs. Third World” reinforce Western superiority. These ideas shape global capitalism, political power, and national hierarchies across Latin America.

The lecture then shifts to national identity and the “Indian Question” after independence. Ideologies such as mestizaje promoted racial mixing as unity while often masking continued Indigenous and Afro-descendant marginalization. Early “Indianesque nationalism” romanticized the Indigenous past but declined as Eurocentric elite power reasserted dominance. The lecture concludes with Quijano’s call for decoloniality. Reject the Eurocentric mirror, recover suppressed knowledge systems, and dismantle enduring colonial power structures.
