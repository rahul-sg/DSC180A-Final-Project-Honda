Week 1 introduced the foundational framework of financial accounting and how businesses communicate economic information. The lecture explained that accounting exists because economic activity is complex, so organizations need structured reporting based on judgment and consistent principles. The core focus was the set of financial statements: the Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Statement of Stockholders’ Equity, and Statement of Cash Flows. Each statement provides a different perspective on a company’s performance and resources, and together they form a connected system rather than standalone reports.

The Balance Sheet presents a snapshot of a company’s assets, liabilities, and equity at a point in time. The Income Statement covers the revenues and expenses over a period, determining net income. That net income links directly into the Statement of Stockholders’ Equity, which updates retained earnings after considering income and dividends. The Statement of Cash Flows explains how cash changed between beginning and end-of-period balance sheets through operating, investing, and financing activities.

A major theme was the idea of linking these statements. The lecture emphasized that the income statement affects equity, which in turn affects the balance sheet, and that the cash flow statement fills in the details behind cash changes. The accounting equation—Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders’ Equity—serves as the backbone of all reporting. Any change in revenues, expenses, or dividends ultimately changes retained earnings and therefore equity.

Overall, Week 1 set up the conceptual foundation needed before learning mechanics. It focused on understanding what each financial statement communicates and how they work together to capture performance, financial position, and cash activity in a structured, standardized way.
