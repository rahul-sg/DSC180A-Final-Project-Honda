The lecture begins with Sonia Nieto’s argument that society categorizes people using visible and invisible traits and attaches fixed assumptions to these labels, often resulting in stereotypes that benefit some groups while harming others. Students are asked to reflect on whether they were labeled in school and how those labels may have shaped their self-image, motivation, and perceived abilities. The lecture then addresses the silence, fear, and denial that often surround conversations about race and cultural difference, emphasizing that courage is required to confront how social views and upbringing shape attitudes toward race.

Race is then defined as a social construction, not a biological reality, a view widely accepted in the social sciences and genetic research. Racial categories shift historically through political struggle and economic conditions and become “common sense” through everyday learning. The project Race: Are We So Different? is introduced to dispel biological myths of race. Ian Haney López explains how law constructs race by shaping physical appearance, immigration status, and social meaning through coercive legal rules and policies.

The lecture next examines naturalization and immigration, defining citizenship requirements such as language, civic knowledge, and “good moral character,” and shows how racial classification shaped who could become a citizen. Irish and Italian immigrants became classified as white over time. James Baldwin’s quote emphasizes that whiteness was socially created through generations of coercion. The U.S. Census is introduced as a tool that forces racial identification and shows how categories change over time. Legal cases involving Armenians, Japanese immigrants, and Mexicans demonstrate how race and rights were inconsistently defined by law. Miscegenation laws banning interracial marriage remained until 1967.

The lecture then shifts to language, showing how racial and ethnic terms change over time. Culture is defined using Nieto’s framework as dynamic, learned, multifaceted, and constantly changing. Culture is shaped by many mediating factors including family, race, gender, class, language, and community. Schools are presented as institutions with their own distinct culture and assumptions about ability, intelligence, and student behavior, which strongly shape students’ educational experiences.
