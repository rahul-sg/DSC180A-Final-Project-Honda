The lecture begins by reviewing evolution as the change in allele frequencies over time within a population and the three postulates of natural selection: struggle for existence, variation in traits related to survival and reproduction, and inheritance of those variations. Darwin’s major difficulty was explaining how variation is maintained, how traits are inherited, and where new traits originate. Artificial selection is introduced as evidence of rapid evolutionary change, with dogs and pigeons as key examples. Rates of evolutionary change are shown to vary, from slow incremental changes such as eye evolution to rapid shifts observed in species like minnows.

The mechanisms of heritability are traced to Gregor Mendel, whose pea plant experiments demonstrated that inherited “particles” from each parent preserve variation. These particles were later identified as DNA housed in chromosomes, discovered by Walther Flemming, and formalized in the Chromosome Theory of Inheritance by Sutton and Boveri. Chromosomes occur in homologous pairs, with humans having 46 total. Mitosis produces identical somatic cells, while meiosis produces haploid sex cells and introduces variation through mutation and recombination.

Mendel’s results define genes, alleles, genotype, phenotype, dominance, and recessiveness, with inheritance patterns visualized through event trees and Punnett squares. Independent assortment and crossing-over explain genetic recombination, while recombination rate measures the frequency of crossover between genes.

The lecture then shifts to DNA history and structure, highlighting Watson, Crick, and Rosalind Franklin’s discovery of the double helix. DNA consists of a sugar-phosphate backbone and base pairs A-T and C-G. Genes are functional DNA sequences, and humans possess around 20,000–25,000. Mitochondrial DNA, inherited only from mothers, is used to study ancestry, including Mitochondrial Eve. DNA also functions as a molecular clock to estimate evolutionary divergence.
