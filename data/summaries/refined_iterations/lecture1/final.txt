The lecture introduces the **financial accounting framework**, describing accounting as the *language of business* that tells a company’s financial story—its performance, risks, and opportunities—through systematic identification, measurement, and recording of economic events. It fulfills two main roles: **recordkeeping**, which captures a firm’s financing, investing, and operating activities; and **communication**, which organizes that information into financial statements for external users.

Financial information serves multiple audiences, including investors, creditors, suppliers, management, boards of directors, employees, customers, analysts, regulators, and others. These stakeholders rely on accounting reports to assess profitability, credit risk, management effectiveness, and long‑term stability. Financial accounting differs from managerial accounting, which supports internal decision making, and from financial statement analysis, which focuses on company valuation.

The **financial reporting process** summarizes business activities into four primary statements—the **Balance Sheet**, **Income Statement**, **Statement of Stockholders’ Equity**, and **Statement of Cash Flows**—each governed by **Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)** to ensure consistency and comparability. The **Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)** requires periodic statements from public companies and delegates standard‑setting to the **Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)**; international reporting follows **IFRS** set by the **IASB**. Independent **auditors** evaluate whether statements comply with GAAP and are free of material misstatements, issuing opinions that enhance the reliability of reported information.

The lecture then applies the framework to the **Balance Sheet**, which shows a company’s financial position at a specific date based on the **accounting equation**  
**Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders’ Equity.**  
Assets are resources with future economic benefits (e.g., cash, equipment, land, supplies, patents). Liabilities are obligations to creditors (e.g., payables, notes, taxes), and stockholders’ equity represents owners’ residual claims after debts are settled. Each transaction has a **dual effect**, maintaining balance in the equation.

Through the **Klein, Inc.** example, students see how this balance operates. Issuing stock and obtaining a bank loan generate the financing needed to begin operations. Purchasing equipment, paying prepaid rent, and buying supplies illustrate investing and operating activities. Each action changes at least two parts of the accounting equation, demonstrating how financing and resource use shape total assets, liabilities, and equity while keeping the balance sheet in equilibrium.
