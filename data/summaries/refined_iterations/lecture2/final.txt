This week’s lecture extended the foundation of financial accounting by linking the financial statements and introducing double‑entry recording. It opened with brief updates, then emphasized that accounting interprets complex economic activity and communicates it through structured financial statements.  

The four fundamental reports—the balance sheet, income statement, statement of stockholders’ equity, and statement of cash flows—work together to describe a firm’s position and performance. The balance sheet captures assets, liabilities, and equity at a specific date, while the other statements summarize changes over the fiscal period. Those changes explain how conditions move from one balance‑sheet date to the next. Revenues raise and expenses lower retained earnings; therefore, net income increases stockholders’ equity, and a net loss decreases it.  

The lecture then expanded the accounting equation—Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders’ Equity—by showing equity as contributed capital plus retained earnings. Retained earnings evolve from beginning balance + net income – dividends, or more specifically + revenues – expenses – dividends. This equation also frames account updates: beginning balance + increases – decreases = ending balance, ensuring each period’s ending balances become the next period’s beginning balances.  

The core section explained double‑entry mechanics. Every transaction has a dual effect recorded as equal debits and credits, keeping A = L + SE in balance. Debits increase assets and decrease liabilities or equity; credits have the opposite effect, and no negative numbers are used. The lecture illustrated these rules through a sequence of transactions—borrowing from a bank, buying equipment and inventory, paying suppliers, purchasing prepaid insurance, and issuing stock—showing how each affects accounts and maintains equality.  

Visual tools reinforced the system. The “super T‑account” organized all major accounts (assets, liabilities, contributed capital, retained earnings, revenues, expenses, and dividends) and showed their normal debit or credit sides. The mnemonic **DEALOR** summarized these patterns: Dividends, Expenses, and Assets carry debit balances, while Liabilities, Owner’s Equity, and Revenues carry credit balances.  

Finally, the lecture outlined the accounting process: (1) analyze each economic event, (2) record the debits and credits as journal entries, and (3) post them to T‑accounts to determine ending balances. Ensuring that total debits equal total credits both preserves the accounting equation and forms the basis for accurate financial statement preparation across periods.
