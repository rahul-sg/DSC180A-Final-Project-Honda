  "refined_summary": "This lecture expands on An\u00edbal\u202fQuijano\u2019s concept of the **\u201ccoloniality of power\u201d** and its lasting impact on modernity, capitalism, and identity in Latin\u202fAmerica. Quijano, a Peruvian sociologist, developed his thought from **dependency theory** (centered on political economy and development), through studies of **culture and historiography**, to **decolonial theory**, which explores how colonial relations of knowledge and power persist beyond formal colonialism. His ideas form part of the **Modernity/Coloniality/Decoloniality (MCD) project**, which reexamines world history through three interlinked lenses:  \n\n- **Modernity**\u2014rethinking historical narratives that present Western progress as universal, aligning with Stuart\u202fHall\u2019s critique of the \u201cWest and the Rest.\u201d  \n- **Coloniality**\u2014highlighting enduring structures of domination that privilege Western epistemologies and obscure Indigenous and Afro\u2011descendant worldviews.  \n- **Decoloniality**\u2014centering non\u2011Western languages, cosmologies, and ways of being to unsettle Eurocentric hierarchies.  \n\nQuijano argues that the **coloniality of power** emerged through two foundational processes: (1) the construction of racial difference between conquerors and conquered, and (2) the organization of labor through systems such as slavery, encomienda, and mita. These regimes tied **race, labor, and social order** to the rise of global capitalism. Over time, **Eurocentrism** naturalized these inequities\u2014casting Europe as the sole source of reason and progress\u2014and continues to shape ideas of \u201cdevelopment,\u201d \u201cdemocracy,\u201d and \u201csuccess.\u201d  \n\nThe lecture traced how coloniality endures in both structural and cultural forms. The film *Roma* was discussed as an example where class, gender, and Indigeneity reproduce colonial hierarchies despite a contemporary setting. A focus on **heterogeneity and discontinuity** challenged linear European models of history, emphasizing situated, plural modernities that recognize diverse forms of agency and change.  \n\nTurning to **national identity**, historian **Rebecca\u202fEarle\u2019s** analysis of *\u201cIndianesque nationalism\u201d* shows early post\u2011independence elites celebrating a romanticized Indigenous past to mark distance from Spain while excluding living Indigenous peoples. Later **mestizaje** ideologies appeared to unify nations through racial mixing but often reinforced whiteness and erased Afro\u2011descendant and Indigenous experiences\u2014illustrating how Eurocentrism continued to frame nation\u2011building.  \n\nFinally, Quijano\u2019s call for **decoloniality** urges societies to reject the distorted reflection of the Eurocentric \u201cmirror\u201d and recover marginalized perspectives as sources of knowledge and power. The week concluded with media\u2011based questions inviting students to apply these concepts\u2014examining contemporary examples of colonial legacies and considering how Quijano\u2019s framework might inform concrete efforts toward dismantling the global matrix of domination.",
