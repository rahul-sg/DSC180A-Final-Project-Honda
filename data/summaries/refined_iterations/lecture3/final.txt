This lecture expands on Aníbal Quijano’s concept of the **“coloniality of power”** and its lasting impact on modernity, capitalism, and identity in Latin America. Quijano, a Peruvian sociologist, developed his thought from **dependency theory** (centered on political economy and development), through studies of **culture and historiography**, to **decolonial theory**, which explores how colonial relations of knowledge and power persist beyond formal colonialism. His ideas form part of the **Modernity/Coloniality/Decoloniality (MCD) project**, which reexamines world history through three interlinked lenses:  

- **Modernity**—rethinking historical narratives that present Western progress as universal, aligning with Stuart Hall’s critique of the “West and the Rest.”  
- **Coloniality**—highlighting enduring structures of domination that privilege Western epistemologies and obscure Indigenous and Afro‑descendant worldviews.  
- **Decoloniality**—centering non‑Western languages, cosmologies, and ways of being to unsettle Eurocentric hierarchies.  

Quijano argues that the **coloniality of power** emerged through two foundational processes: (1) the construction of racial difference between conquerors and conquered, and (2) the organization of labor through systems such as slavery, encomienda, and mita. These regimes tied **race, labor, and social order** to the rise of global capitalism. Over time, **Eurocentrism** naturalized these inequities—casting Europe as the sole source of reason and progress—and continues to shape ideas of “development,” “democracy,” and “success.”  

The lecture traced how coloniality endures in both structural and cultural forms. The film *Roma* was discussed as an example where class, gender, and Indigeneity reproduce colonial hierarchies despite a contemporary setting. A focus on **heterogeneity and discontinuity** challenged linear European models of history, emphasizing situated, plural modernities that recognize diverse forms of agency and change.  

Turning to **national identity**, historian **Rebecca Earle’s** analysis of *“Indianesque nationalism”* shows early post‑independence elites celebrating a romanticized Indigenous past to mark distance from Spain while excluding living Indigenous peoples. Later **mestizaje** ideologies appeared to unify nations through racial mixing but often reinforced whiteness and erased Afro‑descendant and Indigenous experiences—illustrating how Eurocentrism continued to frame nation‑building.  

Finally, Quijano’s call for **decoloniality** urges societies to reject the distorted reflection of the Eurocentric “mirror” and recover marginalized perspectives as sources of knowledge and power. The week concluded with media‑based questions inviting students to apply these concepts—examining contemporary examples of colonial legacies and considering how Quijano’s framework might inform concrete efforts toward dismantling the global matrix of domination.
