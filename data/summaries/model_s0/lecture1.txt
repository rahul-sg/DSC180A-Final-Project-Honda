The lecture introduces the principles and framework of financial accounting, emphasizing its role as the “language of business.” Accounting communicates a company’s financial story—its performance, risks, and opportunities—by identifying, measuring, and recording economic events. The course aims to teach students how financial statements are created and interpreted to support informed business decisions. Unlike managerial accounting or financial statement analysis, this class focuses on external financial reporting.  

Accounting serves both recordkeeping and communication functions. Users of financial information include investors, creditors, suppliers, management, employees, customers, and regulators, all of whom rely on accurate financial statements. Financial accounting records three types of business activities: financing (transactions with investors and creditors), investing (acquiring resources such as buildings and equipment), and operations (day-to-day activities like production and sales). The resulting financial statements—Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Statement of Stockholders’ Equity, and Statement of Cash Flows—summarize a firm’s financial condition and performance.  

The lecture outlines the financial reporting process, guided by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which ensure consistency and comparability. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversees public company reporting, delegating standard-setting to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), while the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) governs IFRS abroad. Independent auditors review financial statements, providing one of four opinions—unqualified, unqualified with explanatory note, qualified, or adverse—to enhance credibility.  

A detailed discussion of the Balance Sheet follows. It reports a company’s financial position at a specific date, showing that Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders’ Equity. Through examples such as establishing Klein, Inc., the lecture demonstrates how financing and investing transactions affect this equation. Assets are categorized as current or noncurrent depending on liquidity or duration of benefit; liabilities are classified as current or long-term based on repayment timing; and stockholders’ equity reflects owners’ residual interest through common stock and retained earnings. The balance sheet must always remain in equilibrium, capturing the company’s resources and the claims against them.
