This lecture explores Aníbal Quijano’s concept of the “coloniality of power” and its enduring effects on modernity, capitalism, and national identity in Latin America. Quijano, a Peruvian sociologist, advanced from dependency theory and cultural studies to develop decolonial theory, which critiques the global hierarchies of knowledge and power created through colonialism. His work identifies three interrelated dimensions within the modernity/coloniality/decoloniality (MCD) framework: modernity’s Eurocentric narratives of progress, coloniality’s ongoing structures of epistemic and social domination, and decoloniality’s efforts to re-center non-Western knowledge, culture, and being.

The lecture emphasizes two historical processes forming the “coloniality of power”: the invention of racial distinctions separating “West” and “Rest,” and new systems of labor control emerging in the Americas. Colonial capitalism relied on slavery, the encomienda, and the mita to organize production for global markets, embedding racial hierarchies into economic and political structures. These racialized divisions of labor shaped access to privilege, resources, and authority, while Eurocentrism naturalized Western dominance as historical “progress.”

Quijano contrasts these inherited hierarchies with decolonial thinking, which calls for rejecting the Eurocentric mirror that distorts identity and valorizing heterogeneous, localized perspectives. Applications such as the film *Roma* illustrate contemporary manifestations of coloniality—in class, gender, and race relations.

The second half of the lecture connects Eurocentrism to Latin American nation-building and mestizaje ideologies. Historian Rebecca Earle’s concept of “Indianesque nationalism” shows how early independence movements romanticized Indigenous heritage as national symbolism while excluding living Indigenous peoples from full citizenship. Later, mestizaje—celebrated racial mixing—appeared to unify the nation but often reaffirmed whiteness and erased Afro-descendant and Indigenous identities. Through these examples, the lecture underscores Quijano’s call for decoloniality: to disentangle knowledge, power, and identity from Eurocentric frameworks and to envision plural ways of knowing and being beyond colonial logics.
