This lecture builds on foundational accounting principles by explaining how financial statements connect and how transactions are recorded using the double-entry system. It begins by emphasizing that accounting is a judgment-based discipline that interprets complex economic activities through structured reporting. The four key financial statements—the balance sheet, income statement, statement of stockholders’ equity, and statement of cash flows—are introduced as interrelated tools of financial communication. The balance sheet represents a company’s position at a point in time, while the income statement, equity statement, and cash flow statement describe activities over a fiscal period. Net income or loss drives changes in stockholders’ equity, showing how revenues increase and expenses decrease retained earnings.  

The lecture then develops the accounting equation, which states that assets equal liabilities plus shareholders’ equity. Equity is further broken down into contributed capital and retained earnings, which evolve through revenues, expenses, and dividends. This expanded equation forms the foundation for recording transactions and maintaining balanced accounts across periods.  

The core of the lecture details the double-entry accounting system, where each transaction has equal debit and credit effects to preserve the balance sheet equation. Debits increase assets and decrease liabilities or equity; credits have the opposite effect. The “D E A L O R” mnemonic (Dividends, Expenses, Assets, Liabilities, Owners’ equity, Revenue) helps recall which accounts normally carry debit or credit balances. Through successive examples—borrowing funds, purchasing equipment or inventory, paying suppliers, prepaying insurance, and issuing stock—students see how journal entries and T-accounts reflect these transactions. Ending balances from T-accounts become beginning balances in the next period, linking accounting cycles across time.  

Finally, the lecture summarizes the recording process: analyze transactions, journalize entries, and post to the ledger. The fundamental rule that “debits equal credits” ensures the accuracy and integrity of the financial statements and the overall accounting framework.
